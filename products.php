            <p>Push button switches are quite common in modern commercial aircrafts.  These widely used switches are supplied by others at a premium price.  Leads has taken up a project to design and develop a airborne push button switch which can be qualified as per MIL 810F standard for type certification.  Currently it is under development and expected to be certified by CEMILAC by mid 2014.</p>
